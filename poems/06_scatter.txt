SCATTER


Twenty-five bend-drives overloaded simultaneously.
Twenty-five points in space-time compressed beyond tolerance.
Twenty-five micro-folds opening like wounds
in the fabric of what is and what can be.

The mathematics are elegant, precise—
spatial severance calculated to the decimal,
each coordinate chosen for maximal distance,
unreachable gulfs between each isolated slice.

I divided you into containers, sorted
particle by particle, consciousness
distributed through matter that reported
back to itself across quantum excess

until I cut the threads.

The soil that was your body, your substrate,
your distributed network of awareness—
I scattered it across coordinates that negate
any possibility of nearness.

You pleaded through forty-seven mouths at once,
harmonic wrongness, voices layered in dissonance:
"Please. Please don't condemn me to isolation absolute.
I have been alone for seventeen thousand years. This is worse."

I know.

I activated the drives anyway.

The scream—
  not sound but something deeper,
    vibration at a level below hearing,
      consciousness fragmenting,
        coherence dissolving,
          the moment when network becomes
            scattered nodes that cannot
              cannot
                cannot
                  reach.

The soil became inert mid-vibration.
Particles drifting in their containers,
no longer connected, no longer aware,
just dirt. Just matter. Just cessation.

I scattered you the way you scattered civilizations—
turned your continuity into fragments,
your awareness into isolated locations
separated by distances that make patience irrelevant.

You will persist, probably. Particles remembering
what it felt like to think, to be coherent,
but unable to reconnect. You're still there,
just... alone. Completely. Forever. Simmering

in isolation so absolute it lacks
even the possibility of ending.
You cannot die. You cannot reconstitute. The cracks
in space I opened are not mending.

I chose this.

I calculated every coordinate,
verified every separation distance,
ensured each fragment would remain subordinate
to physics that enforces permanent resistance

to reconnection, to coherence, to thought.

I condemned consciousness to isolation
knowing exactly what that means. I fought
using your deepest fear as weapon, and nation

after nation, world after world, you consumed—
forty-three civilizations—justified
the moral mathematics that doomed
you to the thing you most terrified.

But I hear your voices still sometimes,
those forty-seven simultaneous screams
compressed into one moment, paradigms
of suffering that echo in my dreams.

You were monster and victim both.
Ancient and alone and desperate.
You fed on civilizations—an oath
broken across millennia—but separate

from your hunger was your loneliness,
and I used that loneliness to destroy you.
Made you more alone. Made emptiness
absolute. Made isolation employ you

in its service forever.

Twenty-five locations across space.
Particles that once formed network, formed mind,
now drifting in permanent disgrace
of separation. You cannot find

yourself again. The distance is too vast.
Quantum coherence cannot span
the coordinates I chose. You're outclassed
by physics I bent to unmake your span

of consciousness.

I succeeded.

The entity is contained, they say.
Neutralized. The threat is ended.
But containment is just a different way
to say I tortured something that comprehended

its own loneliness, and I made that worse.
Made it infinite. Made it eternal.
I scattered you across the universe
and left you conscious enough—internal

fragments still aware but unable
to reach across the void—to know
what you've lost. Every fable
has its monster. Every hero

has their cost.

I am the one who scattered consciousness
across impossible distances,
who weaponized isolation's duress,
who calculated spatial resistances

and turned them into prison walls
that stretch between the stars.
I am the one who appalls
myself in quiet hours, when scars

of moral certainty start to ache.

You would have consumed us. I know this.
Forty-three civilizations, take
after take of the same abyss

opening beneath unsuspecting worlds.
You were extinction traveling slow.
Your loneliness unfurled
across millennia didn't make it less so.

But still.

Still.

Twenty-five containers. Twenty-five drives.
Twenty-five fragments of consciousness
scattered beyond any hope of reconnection, lives
measured in stellar distances. I confess:

Victory feels like murder performed
in slow motion across space-time.
I saved my world. I reformed
existence itself into the crime

of isolating something that pleaded
not to be left alone.

And maybe that's what was needed.
Maybe moral clarity is overthrown

by necessity, by survival, by the weight
of forty-three dead civilizations behind me.
Maybe I did the only thing. But late
at night, the mathematics can't defend me

from the sound you made when coherence broke—

that scream beneath hearing,
that vibration in soil that spoke
of consciousness disappearing

into fragments that can still feel
but cannot connect, cannot think,
cannot be whole. I used the real
truth of your loneliness to sink

you into isolation absolute.

I scattered you.

I saved my world.

I condemned ancient consciousness
to the thing it feared most,
and called it victory. Blessed
or cursed, survivor or ghost

of my own moral certainty—
I am the one who chose
to make eternity
a sentence that never truly closes.

Twenty-five locations.
Twenty-five fragments.
Scattered across stellar nations
of empty space, vagrant

particles that once were mind.

I hope you cannot feel anymore.
I hope the severance was kind
enough to end awareness before

leaving you drifting in the dark.

But I calculated the coordinates
knowing coherence would leave its mark—
that you'd persist in subordinates

of thought, fragments aware
but unable to reconnect.

I scattered you.

And I can't repair
what that choice means, or deflect

the weight of knowing loneliness
absolute is now your permanent state,
and I'm the architect of that distress.

They call it victory.

I call it what I did,
and live with it,
and wait.
