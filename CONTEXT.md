We are developing a dark sci-fi story. We have developed a high level concept in CONCEPT.md. We want to initially develop CHARACTERS.md but think perhaps we should develop the story more first and allow the main characters to develop naturally. 

This should by no means be forced, but we would like that if possible most chapters ended on 1-2 sentences of a beautifal metaphor relevant to the story at that point, almost poetic. 

We want to develop the plan for the story arc, acts, and chapter summaries, then we might develop characters and plot points further. Then I would have you create one chapter at a time, in chapters/ directory. After story is completed, we would then create poems related to the story in poems/, preferrably mostly rhyming. 

This will eventually all be used for TTS in an app I am working on, and I would like for each chapter's estimated TTS read time to be roughly 6-12 minutes, but this is not strict and we should bend this rule as needed if it fits the story's pace. I would like for each poem's read time to be roughly 1-3 minutes.
